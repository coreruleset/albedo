endpoints:
  - path: "/*"
    methods: [any]
    contentType: any
    description: |
      Requests to any URL that is not defined as an endpoint are accepted if they are valid.
      The response to any such request will be a status 200 without a body.
  - path: /capabilities
    methods: [GET]
    contentType: "-"
    description: | 
      Returns a JSON document describing the capabilities of albedo, i.e., available endpoints and their functions.
      If the query parameter 'quiet' is set to 'true', the response will only contain the path property for each
      endpoint.
  - path: /reflect
    methods: [POST]
    contentType: application/json
    description: |
      This endpoint responds according to the received specification.
      The specification is a JSON document with the following fields:

        status      [integer]: the status code to respond with
        headers     [map of header definitions]: the headers to respond with
        body        [string]: body of the response
        encodedBody [base64-encoded string]: body of the response, base64-encoded; useful for complex payloads where escaping is difficult
        logMessage  [string]: message to log for the request; useful for matching requests to tests

      While this endpoint essentially allows for freeform responses, some restrictions apply:
        - responses with status code 1xx don't have a body; if you specify a body together with a 1xx
          status code, the behavior is undefined
        - response status codes must lie in the range of [100,599]
        - the names and values of headers must be valid according to the HTTP specification;
          invalid headers will be dropped
  - path: /configure_reflection
    methods: [POST]
    contentType: application/json
    description: |
      This endpoint configures other endpoints to respond as described by the received specification.
      Any configured endpoint will behave as if it were the "/reflect" endpoint and will retain its configuration.
      Endpoints can be overridden with new configurations.

      The specification is a JSON document with the same fields as in the specification for "/reflect", with the following additions:

        endpoints [list of endpoints]: endpoints to configure; an endpoint has the following fields:
                  method                  [string]: HTTP method to match
                  url                     [string]: URL of the endpoint, including query and fragment
  - path: /reset
    methods: [PUT]
    contentType: any
